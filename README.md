# droidbones
<em><h4>A Web App to easily generate Android Layouts</h4></em> <br>
To Deal with the nesting of layouts in order to achieve a grid like <br>
pattern (similar to bootstrap), I made droid bones. Use the GUI to make <br>
rows and columns in which you can put your content.<br>
currently, each row and column has a weight of 1. Almost all of the code for <br>
droidbones is client side js. Let me know what you think.
